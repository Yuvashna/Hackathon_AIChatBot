# Hackathon_AIChatBot
This website was presented at the 2023 GirlCode Hackathon, the theme was #AIforWomen.

Our group focused on providing an assessment platform where individuals could answer a set of specific questions on a chat bot.
Based on the answers provided, the AI would analyze these answers and look for keywords, these keywords were processed and at the end users were given a percentage/probablity of how likely the relationship
they are in is abusive.

The application was made in a span of 24 hours and still needs some improvement.
